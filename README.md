# cLib

cLib is a personal library used to avoid having to copy and paste an insane amount of dependencies, files and other resources to the projects I do.

The objective is to provide a variety of my own resources and other resources from other good libraries.

## List of Utilities Available
1. Extension Functions
2. Cooldown
3. Placeholder Utility

### Extension Functions
At the moment a little basic extension functions are available. The most importants one can be found at [Code](https://github.com/cirosanchez/cLib/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/me/cirosanchez/cLib/extension).

### Cooldown
Cooldown class provides a cooldown manager for an specific function.

An example using [Lamp Command Framework](https://github.com/Revxrsal/Lamp) for a simple message command with Cooldown implemented.
```kotlin
@Command("msg","message","pm")
@CommandPermission("survival.command.message")
@Description("Send a private message to another player.")
class MessageCommand {

    val cooldown = Cooldown()

    @DefaultFor("~")
    fun default(actor: Player, target: Player, string: String){

        val uuid = actor.uniqueId
        
        if (cooldown.hasCooldown(uuid)){
            val secs = cooldown.getRemainingCooldown(uuid)
            actor.sendMessage("<red>You're in cooldown! Please wait <yellow>{$secs}s</yellow></red>")
            return
        }

        cooldown.setCooldown(actor.uniqueId, Duration.ofSeconds(3))

        target.sendMessage("From ${actor.name}: "+string.colorize())
    }

}
```


### Placeholder Utility
This placeholder utility makes thirty times easier to implement native placeholders. 

```kotlin
  val string = "Hey i am %name%. I am a %placeholder%"
  val placeholder = Placeholder("%placeholder%", "dog")
  val otherPlaceholder = Placeholder("%name%", "John Doe")

  val modifiedString = string.placeholders(placeholder, otherPlaceholder)
  // Result = "Hey i am John Doe. I am a dog"


  // Player Usage
  player.sendMessage(modifiedString.placeholders(placeholder, otherPlaceholder).colorize()) // To be improved in next release.
```


Thanks for using this library, I'll try to update it regularly with new technologies I found! I am in my senior year and I don't have a lot of spare time, but for sure this won't be abandoned entirely.
